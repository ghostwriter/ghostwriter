All of my open-source projects are open to **contributions**, **feedback**, and **suggestions**.

If you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to contribute:
- **Open an issue**
- **Submit a pull request**

Managing hundreds of projects as a hobby is an incredible workload, and every contribution helps!

> - **contributions** must be **attributed** and or **compensated**.
> - have the confidence to make **impactful decisions** that are **selfish**, **your well-being is more important**!
> - **good** products **fail** because of **bad marketing**, **awful** products **succeed** with **great marketing**.
> - **AI** processes **input** (your questions and data) and generates **output** based on **patterns** and **algorithms**.
